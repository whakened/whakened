# Overview

Hey, me. worcestershire sauce, whakened, whatever. I dont know. I make things, they break, I forget about them for 8 months.

At the time of writing this, I am currently working on the following:
- A website
- A game where the controls are the manipulation of gravity
- An unnamed game with no revealed details

I have no finished projects. I leave everything undone. Bad habit, but I still get my enjoyment out of the process.
I will however release things to the public as soon as I consider them polished enough.

Speaking of that, I should have some old and dated projects released to the public by the time you've read this. While they are not polished; I still am rather satisfied with their outcome as of now.
